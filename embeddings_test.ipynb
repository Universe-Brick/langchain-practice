       "\"\\nLangsmith is a tool that can assist with testing by providing various features and functionalities. Here are some ways Langsmith can help with testing:\\n\\n1. Automated Testing: Langsmith provides a built-in test automation framework that allows you to write and run automated tests for your web application. This can save time and resources compared to manual testing, and can also help ensure consistent testing results.\\n2. Mock APIs: Langsmith's mock API feature allows you to create mock implementations of external APIs that your web application may rely on. This can be useful for testing the behavior of your application when it encounters unexpected errors or responses from external APIs.\\n3. Fixtures: Langsmith provides a fixture system that allows you to define and reuse test data sets. This can help ensure consistency and reproducibility across different tests, and can also simplify the testing process by reducing the amount of code required to set up test data.\\n4. Test-Driven Development (TDD): Langsmith supports test-driven development (TDD) by providing a framework for writing and running tests before implementing the corresponding code. This can help ensure that your code is testable and maintainable, and can also help catch bugs early in the development process.\\n5. Integration Testing: Langsmith provides a built-in integration testing feature that allows you to test how different components of your web application interact with each other. This can help ensure that your application functions as expected when different components are used together.\\n6. Performance Testing: Langsmith provides a performance testing feature that allows you to measure the performance of your web application under different loads and conditions. This can help identify bottlenecks and optimize the performance of your application.\\n7. Security Testing: Langsmith provides a security testing feature that allows you to test for common web application vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). This can help ensure that your application is secure and protected against potential attacks.\\n8. API Documentation: Langsmith provides a built-in API documentation feature that allows you to create and manage documentation for your APIs. This can help ensure that your API is well-documented and easy to use, which can improve the overall quality of your web application.\\n9. Code Coverage Analysis: Langsmith provides a code coverage analysis feature that allows you to measure the percentage of your code that is covered by tests. This can help you identify areas of your codebase that may need more testing attention.\\n10. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Langsmith supports continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, which allow you to automatically run tests and deploy your web application after changes are made to the codebase. This can help ensure that your application is always up-to-date and running smoothly.\\n\\nOverall, Langsmith provides a comprehensive set of features that can help improve the quality and reliability of your web application by providing automated testing capabilities, mock APIs, fixtures, TDD support, integration testing, performance testing, security testing, API documentation, code coverage analysis, and CI/CD support.\""

We identify how tasks in the five major subdomains of accounting (i.e., financial, managerial, audit, tax, and systems) have historically required an analytical mindset, and we then explore how those tasks can be completed more effectively and efficiently by using big data analytics. We then present a FACT framework for guiding big data analytics: Frame a question, Assemble data, Calculate the data, and Tell others about the results.\n",

This course totals 60 teaching hours.\\r\\nIn the first course, including three sections. In the first section, we bridge accountancy to analytics. We identify how tasks in the five major subdomains of accounting (i.e., financial, managerial, audit, tax, and systems) have historically required an analytical mindset, and we then explore how those tasks can be completed more effectively and efficiently by using big data analytics. We then present a FACT framework for guiding big data analytics: Frame a question, Assemble data, Calculate the data, and Tell others about the results.\\r\\nThe second course focuses on developing Python skills for assembling business data.
