      "       隨著科技的進步，電腦運算量得以大幅提升，人工智慧運算被視為用來解決人類問題的方式之一，學習神經元的神經網路運作模式，新興記憶體元件能夠模仿神經元的傳遞方式與運作方法，能夠作為記憶體運算以及類神經網路運算的基本單元。因此，本課程將深入介紹各種記憶體、類神經網路以及兩者如何相互結合來達到人工智慧運算。Today, computing power drastically increases as technology evolves. AI is considered as one of possible solutions to the problems that human beings are facing now. In addition, emerging memories have some important features that can emulate the working mechanisms between neurons and synapses. Hence, they can be the building blocks for both computing-in-memory and neural networks. So, in this course, students will learn memory technology, neural networks and the combination of these two technologies to achieve AI.\n",

Then use the basic cognition of permutation and combination to understand the meaning of various distributions. In this semester course, learners will fully understand the relationship between several special assignments, such as the definition of Bernoulli assignment, binomial assignment, geometric assignment, negative binomial assignment, etc. and their relationship. The course also allows learners to understand some of the allocations in continuous allocation, such as the definition of exponential allocation and gamma allocation and their relationships.
