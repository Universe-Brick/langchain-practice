課程第一部分包含三個主題，第一個主題是將會計與資料分析連結，並教授在財務、管理、審計、稅務、系統中的資料分析思維，並教導通用的資料分析框架FACT，包含定義問題框架(Frame a question)、資料蒐集(Assemble data)、計算資料(Calculate the data)、報告結果(Tell others about the results)。
課程第二部分，將運用課程第一部分的概念，聚焦在Python上進行資料分析，並在Jupyter Netbook for Python環境中，進行資料分析處理。This course has two Coursera courses (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign), the first course is ""Introduction to Accounting Data Analytics and Visualization"" (19 teaching hours), and the second course is ""Accounting Data Analytics with Python"" (41 teaching hours). This course totals 60 teaching hours.
In the first course, including three sections. In the first section, we bridge accountancy to analytics. We identify how tasks in the five major subdomains of accounting (i.e., financial, managerial, audit, tax, and systems) have historically required an analytical mindset, and we then explore how those tasks can be completed more effectively and efficiently by using big data analytics. We then present a FACT framework for guiding big data analytics: Frame a question, Assemble data, Calculate the data, and Tell others about the results.
The second course focuses on developing Python skills for assembling business data. It will cover some of the same material from Introduction to Accounting Data Analytics and Visualization, but in a more general purpose programming environment (Jupyter Notebook for Python), rather than in Excel and the Visual Basic Editor."

18	Final Exam","       過去幾年技術和商業領域的根本轉變之一是我們看待和處理與客戶、產品和流程相關的質量問題的方式。 讓客戶滿意正成為世界級製造商的首要經營目標。 統計思維和統計方法已被公認為持續改進的必要知識和工具。 本課程的目的是從系統的角度介紹問題預防驅動的質量工程和控制。 重點將放在使用先進的方法來解決設計過程質量問題和精益生產的創造性思維。 

涵蓋的主題包括： 
1.質量概念概述
2.流程改進週期
3.CTQ
4.過程控制和能力分析
5.過程改進——設計的實驗
6.精益生產
7.案例研究One of the fundamental shifts in the technical and business worlds in the past few years is the way we view and approach the issue of quality relative to customers, products, and processes. To make customer satisfaction is becoming a primary business goal of the world class manufacturers. Statistical thinking and statistical methods have been recognized as the necessary knowledge and tools to the continual improvement. The objective of this course is to introduce problem prevention driven quality engineering and control, from a system point of view. Emphasis will be placed on using advanced methods regarding the issue of design process quality and the creative thinking for lean production. Topics to be covered include: 1. Overview of the quality concept; 2. Process improvement cycle; 3. CTQ; 4. Process control and capability analysis;5. Process improving – designed experiments; 6. Lean production; and 7. Case studies."

We will start from the basic Model-View-Controller design pattern concepts and gradually moving toward to building an App that is location-aware and capable of accessing cloud services. We will emphasize practices via weekly/biweekly homework assignments and term project to enhance your programming skills and your understanding of the Android platform APIs.
